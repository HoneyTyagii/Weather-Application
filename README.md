# weather application
This repository contains the code and resources for my weather application. The weather application is designed to provide users with current weather conditions and forecasts for their desired locations.

Forecast: The app provides a 5-day weather forecast, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Favorites: Users can save their favorite locations to quickly access weather information for those places.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience.

# Technologies Used
HTML: The structure and layout of the app are built using HTML5.

CSS: CSS3 is used for styling and responsive design.

JavaScript: The app's functionality is implemented using JavaScript, including fetching weather data from an API and dynamically updating the UI.
